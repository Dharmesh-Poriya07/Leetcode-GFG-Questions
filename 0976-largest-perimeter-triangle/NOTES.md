sort array in descending order.
let's say triangle side is a,b,c
if **`a+b>c`** and **`b+c>a`** and ** `a+c>b`** then it's follow the triangle inequality and a,b and c make a triangle.
if **`a+b<c`** then we discard c because if we not discard c then any other length which is less than c that is always less than c so we need to discard c.
same for **`b+c<a`** and **`a+c<b`**
